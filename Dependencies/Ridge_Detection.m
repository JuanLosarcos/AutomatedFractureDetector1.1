% Function: Ridge_Detection
% Modified by: Juan Manuel Losarcos (UIC), based on Prabhakaran et al. (2019)
%
% Description:
%   For each image in the input list, applies a set of precomputed shearlet 
%   systems and ridge extraction parameter combinations to compute ridge 
%   responses. All ridge realizations are summed and normalized into a 
%   probabilistic ridge map, resized to the original image dimensions.
%
% Inputs:
%   - InFileList: full paths of images to process
%   - InFileListShort: filenames without path for output naming
%   - no_Shearlets: number of precomputed shearlet systems
%   - RidgeExtract_Combs: matrix of [minContrast, offset] combinations
%   - onlyPositiveOrNegativeRidges: 1 or -1 for ridge polarity
%   - total_combs: total number of shearlet Ã— ridge parameter combinations
%   - outfolder0: path where shearlet systems are stored
%   - output_folder: path to save the resulting ridge maps
%
% Output:
%   - C_Edges_norm: normalized summed ridge response for the last image
%
% Dependencies:
%   - CoSHREM toolbox functions: CSHRMsheardec, CSHRMgetRidges
%   - Requires shearlet systems generated at 1000x1000 resolution
